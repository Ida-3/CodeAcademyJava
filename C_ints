                                                - int only store whole numbers. 
                                                - int can hold zero, positive and negative numbers. 
                                                - The int data type allows values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, inclusive
                                                
                                                - To declare a int variable we must give them a name. 
                                                
                                                For example: 
                                                 
                                                  // int variable declaration
                                                 int yearJavaWasCreated;
                                                 
                                                  // Adds a value
                                                 yearJavaWasCreated = 1996;
