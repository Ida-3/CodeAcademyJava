                                           - Strings are objects with built in behaviour. 
                                           - Strings hold sequences of character. 
                                           
                                           - There are two ways to create a String. 
                                               -  Using a string literal. 
                                               -  calling the class to create a new String Object. 
                                               
                                               A string literal is any sequence of charcater enclosed
                                               in double qoutes (" "). 
                                               Like primitive types, we declare a string variable by specifying the type first; 
                                               
                                               String greeting = "Hello World"; 
                                               
                                               We could also create a new String object by calling the String class
                                               when declaring a String like so: 
                                               
                                               String salutations = new String("Hello World");
