                                         - Java programs have at least one class and one main() methods.    
                                         - Each class represents one real-words idea. 
                                         - The main() methods runs the task of the program. 
                                        
                                         - Java commetns add helpful context to human readers.

                                         - White space is for humans to read code easily. 
                                         - Curly braces mark the scope of a class and method. 
                                         - Semicolons mark the end of a statement.
                                         
                                         - Java is a compiled language. 
                                         
                                         - Compiling catches mistakes in our code. 
                                         - Compilers transform code into an executable class.
