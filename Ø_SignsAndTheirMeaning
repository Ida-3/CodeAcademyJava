                                 Escape sequances have an alternative use in 
                                 java print statements. 
                        
                                 Escape characters begin with the character \
                                 
                                 The \" escape sequance allows us to add quotation amrks " to a string value: 
                                 
                                 System.out.println("\Hello World\"")
                                 // Prints: "Hello World" 
                                 
                                 If we didn't use an escape sequance,
                                 then java would think were using " to the end of the string. 
                                 
                                 Using the \\ escape sequance allows us to the place backslashses in our String text: 
                                 System.out.println("This is the blackslash symbol: \\");
                                 // Prints: This is the backslash symbol: \ 
                                 
                                This is similar to the last example - 
                                just like ", \ usually has a special meaning. 
                                In this case, \ is used to start an escape sequence. 
                                Well, if we don’t want to start an escape sequence and just want a \ in our String, 
                                then we’ll use \\ — we’re using an escape sequence to say that we don’t want \ to be 
                                interpreted as the start of an escape sequence. 
                                
                                If we place \n escape sequance in a String,
                                the compiler will output a new line of text: 
                                
                                System.out.println("Hello\nGoodbye"); 
                                /* 
                                Prints: 
                                Hello 
                                Goodbye
                                */
                                
                                You can think of \n as the escape for "newline".
