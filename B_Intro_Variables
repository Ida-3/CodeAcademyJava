                                           - We store information in variables.
                                           - Nameing a piece of information allows us to use that later. 
                                           - Variables gices context and meaning to data were storing. 
                                           - In java we specify of the information were sorting. 
                                           
                                           
                                           //Primitive datatypes
                                           
                                           - Three main ones are; int, double and boolean. 
                                           
                                           - We must declare a variable to refrence it whitin our program.
                                           Declaring a variable requires that we specify the type and name. 
                                           
                                           //IMPORTANT: always give the variables, easy and understanding names. 
                                           It will be easier to read it ourself, and for others. //
                                           
                                            If you got a ton of job applications, and you wanted to sort
                                           them out, by their age, salary requirements and if they are employed or not.
                                           Example: 
                                           
                                                        int age; 
                                                        double salaryRequirement; 
                                                        boolean isEmployed; 
                                           
                                          - After giving the variables good enough names, We should now add value. 
                                          
                                          Example:      
                                                        int age; 
                                                        double salaryRequirement; 
                                                        boolean isEmployed; 
                                                        
                                                        age = 85; 
                                                        
                                                        System.out.println(age); 
                                                        
                                                        //It will now print out 85;
